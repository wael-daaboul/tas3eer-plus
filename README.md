# Tas3eer+ Project Index

## 1. Project Overview

Tas3eer+ is a simple pricing tool designed for small home-based businesses.

The goal is to help small business owners calculate:

* The real unit cost
* The minimum acceptable price
* The suggested selling price based on profit margin
* Break-even point
* Basic monthly profit estimation

This is NOT an accounting system.
This is NOT ERP software.
This is a focused pricing tool.

## 2. Target Audience (Phase 1)

Small home businesses such as:

* Homemade sweets
* Handmade products
* Perfumes
* Printing services
* Instagram sellers

We are not targeting factories or large enterprises.

## 3. MVP Scope (Phase 1 Only)

The first version must include only:

1. Product creation
2. Raw material cost calculation
3. Labor cost input (hourly rate × time)
4. Monthly fixed expenses input
5. True unit cost calculation
6. Profit margin selection
7. Suggested selling price
8. Break-even calculation
9. Simple monthly profit projection

Anything outside this scope must be postponed.

## 4. Core Philosophy

* Simplicity first
* No complex accounting terminology
* Minimal inputs
* Clear explanations for each field
* Clean interface

## 5. Current Stage

We are currently building the MVP.

No authentication.
No database (initially).
Client-side calculations only.
Static deployment.

Focus: Accuracy + Simplicity.

## 6. Future Phases (Not Now)

* User accounts
* Cloud saving
* Sector-specific templates
* Subscription model
* Mobile app
* Advanced analytics

These are not part of Phase 1.

## 7. AI Instructions

When generating code or features:

* Always respect MVP scope
* Do not add complexity
* Do not introduce unnecessary backend systems
* Keep calculations transparent and readable
* Prioritize clarity over advanced architecture

The success metric is usability and correctness, not technical complexity.
